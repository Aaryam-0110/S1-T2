# Abstract
1. Motivation: The motivation for the current project is based on the increasing need for smart
parking solutions for two-wheeler and four-wheeler vehicles within urban areas. As the number
of vehicles increases, there is a need for efficient management of parking to avoid congestion,
save time, and lessen environmental impact. Therefore, this project targets the contribution
towards making parking systems smarter and more efficient by satisfying the needs of both [R.
et al., 2022].
2. Problem Statement: The problem we have in our mind is to design a probable and costeffective parking counting system for two-wheeler and four-wheeler types of vehicles. Counting
by human beings with conventional methods is always error-prone, and the available automatic
methods are pretty heavy on budget and are complicated ones. We plan to design a solution
that counts both vehicle types correctly without any challenges at all [Gattadi Vinatha, 2021].
3. Features: The design objectives of the Logic Parking Counter for two and four wheelers are
to establish a practical system of counting both types of vehicles with high accuracy. The
cost will be maintained low so that it remains convenient for parking operators in dealing
with both two and four wheelers. Furthermore, an easy-to-use interface will be created so
that it would ease its use by parking management personnel and drivers of the two types of
vehicles. Finally, the system will also be designed to accommodate a variety of sizes of the
parking areas as well as flexible traffic patterns to ensure it runs efficiently in different parking
environments. [Iyangg, 2024]
